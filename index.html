      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence with strong interests in 
        machine learning, computer vision, intelligent systems, and the integration of AI with emerging technologies 
        such as blockchain and autonomous systems. My academic training has equipped me with a solid foundation 
        in both theoretical principles and applied methodologies within modern AI.

      <h2>Academic Background</h2>
      <p>
        I pursued my AI studies through a collaborative program between Nanjing University of Information Science 
        and Technology and South East Technological University. My coursework included Machine Learning, Digital 
        Image Processing, Data Mining, Data Structures and Algorithms, Cloud Computing, and Database Systems. 
        These courses strengthened my understanding of intelligent algorithms, data-driven decision-making, and 
        system-level computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I developed hands-on skills in Python for algorithm implementation and data analysis, utilized MySQL and 
        MongoDB for data management, and gained practical experience with Docker-based containerization through 
        operating systems and cloud computing training.

      <h2>Research & Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Under the supervision of Professor Zhigeng Pan, I participated in research activities involving intelligent 
        algorithms and virtual reality technologies. In 2024, I contributed to a project exploring computational 
        strategies for the traditional Chinese card game Guandan, where I assisted in technical research and 
        drafting a commercial application proposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2025, I joined the Artificial Intelligence Society founded by Professor Pan, engaging in academic 
        discussions and helping promote AI-related research initiatives. These experiences shaped my research 
        mindset and allowed me to understand how theoretical models translate into practical systems.

      <h2>Honors & Competitions</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies, I received multiple awards including the First-Class Scholarship, the “Three-Good 
        Student” honor for two consecutive years, and the “Excellent Student Cadre” award. I actively participated 
        in several national competitions, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>China “Internet+” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition</li>
        <li>Higher Education Press Cup Mathematical Modeling Contest</li>
        <li>MCM / MathorCup Mathematical Modeling Challenge</li>
        <li>FLTRP National English Reading Contest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These experiences enhanced my analytical reasoning, teamwork ability, and interdisciplinary problem-solving skills.

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I aspire to further pursue graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence, with interests in generative AI, 
        autonomous systems, and trustworthy AI. I aim to contribute to the development of impactful, robust, and 
        reliable intelligent technologies capable of addressing real-world challenges.
