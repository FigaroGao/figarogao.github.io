  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence has become a defining force in contemporary technological development, reshaping industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and education. Its ability to learn from data, uncover patterns, and support intelligent decision-making has driven my strong interest in exploring machine perception and algorithmic reasoning. My motivation to pursue a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence arises from both intellectual curiosity and a long-term aspiration to contribute to the development of robust, trustworthy, and human-centered intelligent systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    My undergraduate training at the Waterford Institute (jointly operated by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology and South East Technological University) has provided me with a rigorous foundation in core areas of computer science. Coursework in Machine Learning, Digital Image Processing, Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Mining, Operating Systems, and Cloud Computing allowed me to develop both theoretical insights and hands-on engineering experience. I gained proficiency in Python for algorithm implementation and data analysis, while database modules trained me to work with MySQL and MongoDB in managing structured and unstructured datasets. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving abilities and prepared me to approach AI from both a technical and applied perspective.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research exposure under the guidance of Professor Zhigeng Pan further deepened my interest in applied AI. I participated in projects involving intelligent algorithms for the card game Guandan, contributing to both algorithmic analysis and the preparation of technical documents. Additionally, my involvement in the Artificial Intelligence Society founded by Professor Pan broadened my understanding of emerging research topics and fostered a collaborative research mindset. These opportunities helped me bridge theoretical study with exploratory research and strengthened my commitment to the discipline.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the classroom, I actively engaged in national competitions such as the China “Internet+” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, the National Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Contest, the MCM/ICM, and the FLTRP English Reading Competition. These experiences improved my analytical thinking, teamwork, communication ability, and academic discipline. I was honored with the First-Class Scholarship, the “Three-Good Student” award for two consecutive years, and the “Excellent Student Cadre” recognition—affirming my academic performance and leadership strengths.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am strongly attracted to the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at City University of Hong Kong. The program’s well-structured concentrations—Autonomous Driving, Generative AI, and Trustworthy AI—align closely with my academic interests and long-term professional goals. I believe this program will not only enhance my theoretical understanding of intelligent systems but also equip me with practical competencies required in advanced AI development. With my solid foundation, strong motivation, and ability to learn quickly, I am confident in my capacity to excel in this rigorous academic environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    I sincerely appreciate your consideration of my application and would be honored to advance my academic journey at City University of Hong Kong.
