  <h1>Hello, I'm Zixuan!</h1>
  <p>This is my personal website.</p>
  <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is profoundly transforming the modern world, driving innovation across sectors such as healthcare, education, finance, and beyond. Its capacity to learn, adapt, and solve complex problems has ushered in a new era of intelligent systems that respond intuitively to human needs. My decision to pursue a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence is fueled by a deep intellectual curiosity about how machines perceive and process information( e.g., intelligent algorithms for Blockchain), as well as a strong commitment to contributing to the development of technologies that enhance lives and address real-world challenges.</p>

    <p>Looking back upon my previous study in Artificial Intelligence at Waterford Institute run by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology and South East Technological University, I have cultivated a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of computer science. Courses such as Machine Learning, Digital Image Processing, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Data Mining have not only deepened my understanding of intelligent systems but also sparked my passion for interdisciplinary innovation. Among these areas, I have developed particular proficiency in computer vision, where I applied advanced image processing techniques to real-world datasets and explored the integration of visual intelligence into smart systems. My hands-on experience with Python has further empowered me to implement algorithms efficiently, conduct data analysis, and prototype intelligent applications with clarity and precision. Through Operating Systems and Cloud Computing, I learned system-level concepts and containerization with Docker. Database training enabled me to manage structured and unstructured data using MySQL and MongoDB. These experiences sharpened my problem-solving abilities and prepared me to build intelligent systems, laying the groundwork for advanced AI study.</p>

    <p>Under the mentorship of Professor Zhigeng Pan, a distinguished researcher in artificial intelligence and virtual reality, I actively engaged in several research-oriented initiatives that deepened my understanding of applied AI. In May 2024, I participated in a research group meeting focused on developing intelligent algorithms for Guandan, a traditional Chinese card game. I contributed to the team by assisting in the drafting of a commercial business plan and conducting algorithmic research—an experience that enhanced my ability to translate technical concepts into practical solutions. In July 2025, I joined the Artificial Intelligence Society founded by Professor Pan, where I played an active role in promoting AI education and research. These experiences not only strengthened my technical and analytical skills but also nurtured my collaborative mindset and commitment to advancing the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>Beyond my academic studies, I have consistently demonstrated excellence and initiative throughout my undergraduate years. I was awarded the First-Class Scholarship and won a “Three-Good Student” for two consecutive years and “Excellent Student Cadre”—honors that reflect both my academic performance and leadership capabilities. To further challenge myself, I actively participated in several national-level competitions, including the China “Internet+” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, the Higher Education Press Cup National Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Contest, the MatherCup Mathematical Modeling Challenge, and the FLTRP National English Reading Contest. These experiences sharpened my analytical thinking, enhanced my teamwork and communication skills, and deepened my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, interdisciplinary problems.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I am deeply drawn to pursue my graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence at City University of Hong Kong, a leading institution for computing area in Hong Kong. Your program's cutting-edge and meticulously structured specializations, such as the Autonomous Driving (AD), Generative AI (GenAI), and Trustworthy AI (TAI) streams, strongly align with my academic interests and career aspirations. I have no doubt that this program will equip me with advanced technical capabilities in AI, while also broadening and deepening my knowledge from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It will prepare me to cope with the current and emerging market demands in the IT industry through innovative and impactful work. I am confident that my solid academic foundation, strong technical skills, and proven ability to learn quickly will allow me to excel within your rigorous academic environment.</p>
